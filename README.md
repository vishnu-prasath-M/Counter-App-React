# Counter App

## Overview
This project is a **Counter App** built with **React.js**. It allows users to **increment**, **decrement**, and **reset** a number using buttons. The app provides a simple, interactive interface for managing the counter value, demonstrating React's ability to handle user input and update the UI dynamically.

## Features
- **Increment**: Increases the counter value by one.
- **Decrement**: Decreases the counter value by one.
- **Reset**: Resets the counter back to its initial value (typically 0).
- **Dynamic Updates**: React automatically updates the UI in response to user interactions.
- **Simple and User-Friendly Interface**: Clear buttons and number display for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js** for building the user interface and handling state changes.
- **CSS** for styling and ensuring a clean and simple design.
